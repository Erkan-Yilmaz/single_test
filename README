SingleTest
==========
Run specific testcase/tests or spec/example.

Testing a single spec, a single test, a single testcase or a single example 
is a great timesaver when debugging a small problem while having a large 
testsuite, or a testsuite with a lot of failuresâ€¦

Looks for a file with the name you specified: name or subfolder/name ...
Will search the root folder first(/controllers) and then all subfolders(/controllers/admin)



Example
=======
test: search in test/ unit functional integration
spec: search in spec/ models controllers views helpers

rake test:blog
=> Runs the full BlogTest unit test

rake test:blog:create
=> Runs the tests matching /create/ in the BlogTest unit test

rake spec:blog:create
=> Runs the first example matching /create/ in Blog spec

rake test:u
=> run the first file matching u*_test.rb

rake test:blog_C or test:blog_
=> Runs all tests in the BlogControllerTest functional test

rake test:bl or test:blog_
=> Run the first Test matching bl*_test.rb
